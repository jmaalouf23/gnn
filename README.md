# ylide_gnn

Machine learning models to predict the properties of redox mediators.

This repository uses chemprop's development of a message passing neural network (https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop) to predict thermodynamic properties of
ylide redox mediators. Properties include redox potential, deprotonation free energy, and Hydrogen abstraction energy.
